# CORDEX-CMIP7 Archiving Specifications for Dynamical Downscaling

!!! warning "Under Development"
    This document is currently under development. The specifications described here are preliminary and subject to change.

## Status

The CORDEX-CMIP7 archiving specifications for dynamical downscaling are being developed to align with:

- CMIP7 data standards
- Updated ESGF infrastructure
- Latest CF Conventions
- Community feedback

## Preliminary Scope

When complete, this document will provide specifications for:

1. **DRS elements**: Updated data reference syntax for CORDEX-CMIP7
2. **Global attributes**: Required NetCDF metadata
3. **File naming conventions**: Standardized file naming patterns
4. **Directory structure**: ESGF publication directory layout
5. **File format**: NetCDF format and compression requirements
6. **Coordinate systems**: Grid definitions and coordinate variables
7. **Time handling**: Time coordinate and calendar specifications, file granularity, ...
8. **Registration**: Institution and model registration procedures

## Timeline

The development timeline for CORDEX-CMIP7 archiving specifications will be coordinated with:

- CMIP7 timeline and milestones
- CORDEX community discussions
- ESGF technical readiness

## Feedback

Community input is essential for developing robust specifications. To contribute:

- Open issues at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/archive-specifications/issues)
