DRS elements","text":"<p>The DRS element values must consist of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and '-' (dash). No other character is allowed. The terms in brackets following the DRS element names in the list below indicate whether the values must be taken from a controlled vocabulary ('CV'), i.e. a fixed list of values, must be registered with CORDEX ('CV to register'), or must follow a predefined structure  ('structured form'). Note that most elements must have the same value as the mandatory NetCDF global attribute. </p> <p><code>variable_id</code> (CV) is the short name of the variable. The name is taken from the CORDEX-CMIP6 Variable List or CORDEX-CMIP6 CMOR tables.</p> <p><code>domain_id</code> (CV) is the name assigned to each of the CORDEX regions and includes a flag for resolution as listed in the CORDEX-CMIP6 domain id CV.   </p> <p><code>driving_source_id</code> (CV) is an identifier of the driving data. The name consists of a model identifier. For reanalysis driven runs this is the name of the reanalysis data (ERA5). For runs driven by CMIP6 model data this is the associated CMIP6 source_id, which can be found in the CORDEX-CMIP6 driving source id CV.</p> <p><code>driving_experiment_id</code> (CV) is either \"evaluation\" for the ERA5-driven experiment, the value of the CMIP6 experiment_id from the ScenarioMIP activity, or \"historical\" for the historical experiment from CMIP. The values for driving_experiment_id can be found in the CORDEX-CMIP6 driving experiment id CV.</p> <p><code>driving_variant_label</code> (CV) identifies the ensemble member of the CMIP6 simulation that produced the forcing data. It must have the same value as the variant_label DRS element of the driving CMIP6 simulation (ripf, see CMIP6 DRS Appendix 1:  Global Attributes for Labeling Experiments). For the evaluation experiment driven by ERA5 it is \"r1i1p1f1\". For all invariant fields (frequency = fx, e.g. orog or sftlf), <code>driving_variant_label</code> must be the same as variant_label of the driving CMIP6 simulation (e.g. r1i1p1f1, r2i1p1f1, etc.); r0i0p0f0 is not allowed. <p><code>institution_id</code> (CV to register) is an identifier for the institution that is responsible for generating and providing CORDEX simulations. All CORDEX institutions must be registered to publish their simulations on ESGF. See instructions on how to register an institution and the current state of the CORDEX-CMIP6 institution id CV.</p> <p><code>source_id</code> (CV to register) is an identifier (acronym) of the CORDEX RCM. All CORDEX RCMs must be registered to publish their simulations on ESGF. See instructions on how to register a model and the current state of the CORDEX-CMIP6 source id CV. Different configurations of the same RCM such as different combinations of parameterization schemes or changes in parameters for existing schemes must be reflected in source_id by a free text suffix (e.g. RCM123, RCM123A for Africa or RCM123T for the tropics). RCM simulations with spectral nudging must use the \"SN\" suffix in source_id (e.g. RCM123-SN) while RCM simulations with Newtonian/dynamical nudging must use the \"NN\" suffix (e.g. RCM123-NN).</p> <p><code>version_realization</code> (structured form) is a combination that identifies i) versions of CORDEX datasets (simulations) related to technical, configuration, or postprocessing errors and ii) realizations with different initial conditions for RCMs. This DRS element has the form \"vN-rM\". \"N\" in the version part \"vN\" is 1 for the first release of dataset (v1) and sequential numbers (2, 3, 4, etc.) for any rerun or re-processing of the dataset (v2, v3, v4, etc.). The later version always supersedes the earlier version. \"M'' in the realization part \"rM\" is sequential numbers (1, 2, 3 etc.) that reflect multiple RCM simulations with perturbed initial conditions (r1, r2, r3, etc.) driven by the same GCM and the same GCM member. The version and realization parts are separated by a dash \"-\" (e.g. v1-r1, v1-r2, v1-r3). The version part of this DRS element should not be confused with the ESGF-related DRS element version that has the form \"vYYYYMMDD '' and is only included in the ESGF directory structure (see 4. ESGF Directory Structure).</p> <p><code>frequency</code> (CV) is the output frequency indicator: 1hr - 1 hourly, 3hr - 3 hourly, 6hr - 6 hourly, day - daily, mon - monthly, and fx - invariant fields; see the CORDEX-CMIP6 frequency CV.</p> <p><code>StartTime</code> and <code>EndTime</code> (structured form) indicate the time span of the file content. The format is YYYY[MM[DD[hhmm]]], i.e. the year is represented by 4 digits, while the month, day, hour, and minutes are represented by exactly 2 digits, if they are present at all (monthly output - YYYYMM, daily \u2013 YYYYMMDD, sub-daily - YYYYMMDDhhmm). The <code>StartTime</code> and <code>EndTime</code> of sub-daily instantaneous and average data are based on the time values of the first and last record in the file. The two dates are separated by a dash. All time stamps refer to UTC. Constant fields (<code>frequency=fx</code>) do not have the <code>StartTime</code>-<code>EndTime</code> element in their file names.</p> <p><code>activity_id</code> (CV) - an identifier of different CORDEX activities such as dynamical downscaling (DD) and empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD), see the CORDEX-CMIP6 activity id CV.</p> <p><code>project_id</code> (CV) - project identifier (\"CORDEX-CMIP6\" is the only option)</p>"},{"location":"CORDEX-CMIP6_archiving_specifications_DD/#2-global-attributes","title":"2.

CORDEX domains and horizontal coordinates","text":"<p>The CORDEX domains are defined in the CORDEX domain tables. A domain must lie fully inside the RCM interior computational domain, i.e. in the area left once the relaxation zone is excluded. It is strongly recommended that RCMs using the rotated-pole coordinate system exactly follow the CORDEX grid definition provided. The rotated-pole coordinate system is always defined in terms of rotation of the North Pole in accordance with CF-1.11. All variables from a simulation must be provided on the same grid (i.e., variables on staggered grids must be regridded to the standard grid). Zonal and meridional winds must be provided as real north- and eastward winds if the RCM uses a coordinate system/projection that does not coincide with real north- and eastward directions (e.g. the rotated pole, Lambert Conformal, etc.).</p> <p>The domain acronym is \u2018domain name\u2019-\u2018resolution\u2019, where \u2018resolution\u2019 is the nearest grid spacing in km of the 3 resolutions used in CORDEX-CMIP5 and CORDEX-CMIP6 (50, 25 and 12 km). Changing \u2018resolution\u2019 from degrees, which are related only to the rotated coordinate system (CORDEX-CMIP5), to the more common kilometres allows us to unify the terminology used in CORDEX, making it easily understandable by all users. For example, \"AFR-25\" means the CORDEX-Africa domain with 25 km resolution in a projected coordinate system and 0.22\u00b0 resolution in the rotated pole coordinate system. The resolution flag indicates the resolution of the atmospheric component of CORDEX models. The domain acronyms for the regular grids are the same as those for the corresponding model grid with the letter 'i' appended to the resolution (e.g. \"AFR-25i\").</p> <p>Data must  be provided for the CORDEX domain only, i.e. the relaxation zones must be removed before the data is delivered.

The grid mapping variable crs is of arbitrary type (e.g. char or int) since it contains no data. The shape and size of the Earth used for the model grid must be specified. For a spherical earth this is done via the crs attribute earth_radius. If a model grid specifies an ellipsoid for the shape of the earth then see CF-1.11 Appendix F.</p> <p>The 2-dimensional geographic latitudes and longitudes of the model grid cells (lon and lat) must be also provided as auxiliary coordinates. Longitude coordinates must be strictly monotonically increasing and confined to the range -180 to 360; they must also have absolute values as small as possible given the first two constraints (e.g., store 170 E to 170 W as 170 to 190, but store 150 W to 130 W as -150 to -130, not 210 to 230). </p> <p>For models with native unstructured grids, it is up to the regional CORDEX communities to decide whether data must be remapped to one of the regular lat-lon domain grids (e.g., AFR-25i) or to the most common native RCM grid used for a specific CORDEX domain.</p>"},{"location":"CORDEX-CMIP6_archiving_specifications_DD/#7-time-coordinate","title":"7.
